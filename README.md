# Plagiarism-checker-using-python

This project has two parts:

1- AI text generated detection tool: This code defines a Flask web application that analyzes the content of text files (PDF or Word documents) using a pre-trained GPT-2 language model from the transformers library. The analysis includes determining whether the content is likely generated by an AI, a human, or a combination of both. The results are then displayed on a web page. 

2- Google search detection tool: This code defines a simple Streamlit web application for exporting Google search results to an Excel file. It uses the Google Custom Search JSON API to retrieve search results based on a user-provided query.
